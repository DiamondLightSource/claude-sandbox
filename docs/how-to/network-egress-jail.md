# Configure the network egress jail

The jail is on by default. It blocks private, link-local and connected networks
while allowing internet access, DNS and explicitly allowed IPs. Agents get a
private IPv4-only network namespace; ordinary container shells do not.

With the PyPI launcher, edit `~/.config/claude-sandbox.conf` on the host.
Follow [container configuration](use-the-container-image.md#configure-the-sandbox)
to mount it. In your own devcontainer, edit `/etc/claude-sandbox.conf`
from a terminal outside the agent, and reapply changes after rebuilding or
reinstalling.

## Add the one required container device

The PyPI launcher supplies `/dev/net/tun` automatically. For your own
devcontainer, add this run argument and rebuild:

```json
"runArgs": ["--device=/dev/net/tun"]
```

Missing tun, pasta or namespace support makes agent launch fail closed.
Use rootless Podman: rootful Docker cannot host the default jail.

## Keep a lab device or internal forge reachable

Add one bare IP per line:

```ini
allow-ip = 172.23.1.3
```

This grants access to that device, not just one service. Review each addition.

:::{note} DLS: Diamond GitLab
The shipped config includes `allow-ip = 172.23.142.119` for Diamond GitLab.
Retain that line if you replace the config and need forge access.
Authentication alone does not make a blocked internal IP reachable.

## Reach services on the host's loopback

Use a relay port for services on `127.0.0.1`; `allow-ip` does not route
loopback into the jail:

```ini
local-port = 5432
```

The shipped `local-model-port = 1920` relays lllm2's API for every agent
and enables Pi's model discovery. Other ports use repeatable `local-port`
lines. Every relayed port exposes the whole service behind it.

The outer container must share the service's network namespace. The PyPI
launcher uses host networking by default; `--bridge` prevents its loopback
from reaching host-local services. A custom devcontainer needs host networking
when the service runs on the host.

## Let a browser login reach the agent

A callback relay lets a host browser reach a login server inside the agent's
private loopback. Enable only the fixed ports you need:

```ini
callback-port = 53692   # Pi's Claude subscription login
callback-port = 1455    # Codex browser login
```

The shipped examples are commented out. Ports cannot overlap
`local-port` or `local-model-port`. If a host port is already occupied,
the session warns and skips that relay; use the provider's paste-code,
callback-URL or device-login alternative where available.

The browser must reach the outer container's loopback. For a remote machine,
forward the port through your editor or SSH. Claude Code's variable callback
port uses its code-paste flow instead of a fixed relay.

## A note on Channel Access for Claude

:::{warning} DLS: Channel Access needs unicast
LAN broadcast discovery does not cross the agent's private network namespace.
Set `EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST` to the device IPs, forward it with
[pass-env](pass-environment-variables.md), and allow each IP with `allow-ip`.
Ordinary shells in a host-network container retain broadcast access.
