# Launch isolation and updates

The sandbox is created by the wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/claude`,
`codex` or `pi`. It builds the filesystem mounts, enters the network
jail and starts the selected agent. Missing isolation prerequisites cause
launch to fail.

The real agent binaries live off PATH under `/usr/libexec/claude-sandbox`.
Use the wrapper commands to run agents. Directly invoking a vendor binary
bypasses the wrapper; there is no managed prompt or session hook to stop it.
The environment marker `IS_SANDBOX=1` prevents recursive wrapping of nested
agent calls. It is a convention, not independent proof of isolation.

## Agent updates

Vendor auto-updaters can place an unwrapped binary ahead of the wrapper on
PATH. The installer disables Claude updates with
`env.DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` and `autoUpdates=false` in
`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`. Existing administrator policy is
preserved.

Codex receives `check_for_update_on_startup=false` in
`/etc/codex/managed_config.toml`; the wrapper also sets
`CODEX_UPDATE_DISABLED=1`. A managed file owned by another administrator is
left unchanged with a warning. Pi runs from a read-only standalone package
and skips version checks.

Update agents by upgrading the image and recreating the container, or by
creating a fresh devcontainer. Reinstalling the sandbox preserves existing
agent binaries. See [Upgrade](../how-to/upgrade.md).

## Verify isolation

Use [explicit verification](../how-to/verify-the-sandbox.md) after installation
or configuration changes. The battery checks the sandbox from inside its
filesystem and network boundaries and reports each result.

User and administrator hooks are their own policy. This installer does not
add, remove or modify them.
