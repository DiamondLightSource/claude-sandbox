description: How agent skills ship to claude-sandbox users (ADR 24). The top-level `skills/` tree is installed root-owned under /usr/libexec and ro-bound per skill into each agent's own skills dir INSIDE the jail; `.claude/skills/` is for developing this repo and never ships. Surface before adding, moving or removing a skill, before touching `install_shipped_skills`, `SHIPPED_SKILLS_DIR`, `AGENT_SKILLS_REL`, or before any proposal to copy skills into the user's ~/.claude, install them via a marketplace, or make the bind writable.

# claude-sandbox-shipped-skills

Skills that sandboxed agents should have in every workspace (currently
`vscode-headless`, `claude-sandbox-user` and `verify-sandbox`) reach users through the **sandbox itself**, not through
their `~/.claude`. This skill records the pattern; the `claude-sandbox`
skill records the invariants it rests on (4 and 5: trust anchors live in
`/etc` and `/usr/libexec`, ro in-session, never in a host-shared or
sandbox-rw path).

## Two trees, one rule

| Tree | Purpose | Ships? |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/<name>/` | Skills every sandboxed agent gets | **Yes** |
| `.claude/skills/<name>/` | Skills for developing this repo (invariants, container, networking, triage...) | No |

The path alone tells a reviewer whether a skill reaches users. There is no
manifest or opt-in list to keep in step. A repo-dev skill that a user wants
anyway is theirs to copy into their own `~/.claude/skills` by hand; the
sandbox never does that for them.

`.claude/skills/vscode-headless` is a **symlink** to `../../skills/vscode-headless`
so the skill still loads while developing here. Add the same symlink for any
new shipped skill only if it is useful for repo work; most will not need it.

## How a shipped skill reaches the session

1. `install_shipped_skills` (install.sh) copies `skills/*/` (dirs with a
   `SKILL.md`) to `/usr/libexec/claude-sandbox/skills/`, root-owned,
   world-readable. The tree is **replaced**, not merged, so a skill deleted
   from the repo stops shipping on the next install.
2. `bwrap_argv_build` (claude-shadow) emits one `--ro-bind` **per skill**
   from that tree onto `$HOME/$AGENT_SKILLS_REL/<name>`. `AGENT_SKILLS_REL`
   is a profile knob: `.claude/skills` (Claude), `.codex/skills` (Codex),
   `.pi/agent/skills` (Pi).
3. The launch body pre-creates `~/$AGENT_SKILLS_REL` on the host when
   anything ships (the one deliberate host write; `~/.claude` always exists,
   either in the container or as the shared mount) and warns when a host
   skill of the same name is masked for the session.
4. The wheel force-includes `skills/` (`packaging/pypi/pyproject.toml`) and
   the Dockerfile's `install.sh` function list calls
   `install_shipped_skills`, so clone, wheel and image all ship the same
   tree. CI byte-diffs the wheel's copy against the checkout.

Why per skill and not per tree: Claude Code, Codex and Pi all discover
`<skills dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` exactly one level deep, so binding the tree
would bury every skill one level down. Per-skill binds also leave the user's
own skills in the same directory visible beside the shipped ones.

Why an ro bind and not a copy into `~/.claude`: the user's `~/.claude` is
host-shared across devcontainers (Invariant 2) and rw in-session. A copy
there contaminates a folder the user owns, drifts from the installed
version, and hands a compromised session a writable copy of the skill's
scripts. Under `/usr/libexec` the scripts are exactly what `install` placed.

Why not a managed setting or plugin marketplace: Claude Code has no
system-wide skills directory and no managed key that adds a skills path
(checked 2026-09-15 against the skills and managed-settings docs). Managed
`extraKnownMarketplaces` still installs into the user's plugin cache, needs
network at first use, and is Claude-only. The bind is harness-agnostic.

Shipped 2026-09-15 as 4.2.0 (PR #49). Verified live in all three agents,
check 03 of the battery, and the wheel path from a branch. The full
`verify-sandbox` audit now uses this same skill mechanism; the former
repository-only `.claude/commands/verify-sandbox.md` has been removed.

## Adding a shipped skill

- Put it at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (+ `scripts/` if needed). Scripts are
  called by absolute path from inside the session; they run inside the jail
  with the session's privileges, nothing more.
- A skill's scripts that need host-side setup (apt installs, as
  `install-vscode-driver-deps.sh` does) must tell the agent to ask the user
  to run them **outside** the sandbox and must not be extended beyond that.
  Give the user the installed script path under
  `/usr/libexec/claude-sandbox/skills/<name>/scripts/`, which exists in the
  outer container and is read-only inside the sandbox. No copy is needed.
  Never use the agent's `~/.claude/skills` mount path for outer commands;
  that mount exists only inside the jail.
- Prefix names distinctively enough that they will not collide with a user's
  own skill: a collision is masked for the session, with a warning.
- Tests: `tests/bwrap_argv.sh` scenario 15 (per-skill ro bind at each
  agent's path, builder stays pure); `tests/smoke.sh` (installed tree
  byte-equals `skills/`, nothing written under the test home's
  `~/.claude/skills`). CI's wheel job diffs `tree/skills` against `skills/`.

## Refuse as regressions

- Copying shipped skills into the user's `~/.claude` (host-shared, rw)
  or any path in the sandbox rw set. The source of a bind stays root-owned
  under `/usr/libexec`.
- Turning the per-skill `--ro-bind` into `--bind`, or binding the whole
  tree onto the skills dir (hides the user's own skills, wrong depth).
- Making `SHIPPED_SKILLS_DIR` an env or conf seam: a bind source chosen
  from outside the trust boundary is a new way into the jail. Tests set the
  variable after sourcing the shadow.
- Merging instead of replacing the installed tree (stale skills keep
  shipping with no source to audit).
- Shipping anything under `.claude/skills/` by widening the copy glob.
  Move the skill to `skills/` instead, deliberately.
- A skill whose scripts run unsandboxed on the user's behalf beyond a
  documented package install.
