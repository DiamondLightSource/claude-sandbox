# claude-sandbox-container

The published container image is the **third consumer** of the sandbox
(after the dogfood devcontainer and guest clone+install — see "dogfood ≈
guest" in the `claude-sandbox` skill, whose Invariants 2 and 4 are
mapped onto the image below). Split from that skill so this loads only
on image/launcher topics.

## The image (PR #78)

`ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/claude-sandbox` (built by `.github/workflows/container.yml`
from the root Dockerfile's `claude-sandbox` stage, `FROM` the `developer`
stage) gives non-devcontainer hosts sandboxed Claude via rootless podman + the
`container/claude-container` launcher. Principles already extended here:

- **Dogfood ≈ guest ≈ image**: the image build *sources* `install.sh` and runs
  main()'s function sequence — never a parallel install path. Two deliberate
  build-time skips (both re-run by `container/entrypoint.sh` at start):
  `probe_userns_or_refuse` (a builder probe proves nothing about the runtime
  host) and `link_terminal_config` — the DLS base ships an EMPTY
  `/user-terminal-config` stub, and wiring it at build symlinks
  `~/.claude.json` to a zero-length file the official installer rejects as
  corrupted JSON ("Unexpected EOF"). The entrypoint also seeds `{}` into a
  zero-length `~/.claude.json` (same hazard, first run with a fresh share).
- **Invariant 2 mapping**: the launcher creates one NAMED container per
  project dir so forge PATs are container-scoped without per-launch
  re-paste; `--recreate` ⇒ re-auth. Refuse a "just mount host ~/.config/gh"
  convenience swap.
- **Keeper model (launcher 0.4, 2026-09-11)**: the container's PID 1 is an
  idle bash loop (`KEEPER_CMD`), and every session is `exec -it` into it;
  the launcher `stop`s the keeper when `.ExecIDs` is empty after its
  session. Why: launcher <= 0.3 baked the agent + args as the container
  command, so `start -ai` replayed them and `--agent`/args were silently
  ignored on reuse, and a `--shell` (unsandboxed bash for `gh-auth`) would
  have baked bash as every later launch. Now only `--host-net`/`--mount`
  are create-time, the launcher says so on reuse, and `is_keeper` refuses
  pre-0.4 containers (starting one would run its baked agent detached).
  Refuse: baking the agent back into the create command; making `--shell`
  a sandboxed session (it exists precisely to run the outside-the-jail CLI).
- **Invariant 4 mapping**: durable user conf = host file ro-mounted at the
  canonical `/etc/claude-sandbox.conf`; the entrypoint detects the mount
  (`_is_mount`) and skips re-stamping. Conf stays outside the sandbox rw set.
- A git tag publishes `ghcr.io/...:<tag>` without touching `:latest`
  (`latest` is default-branch-only) — beta images are safe to cut anytime.
- **Launcher versioning (notify-only, by design)**: on a tag build CI
  bakes the tag into the Dockerfile `ARG` → OCI label
  `io.diamondlightsource.claude-sandbox.launcher-version` (else the script's
  `VERSION=` literal, which only a copied script relies on); the uvx entry
  point passes the wheel's tag in as `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_LAUNCHER_VERSION`.
  Each run the launcher compares itself against
  the LOCAL image's label (instant, offline, no container start) and
  prints a curl pinned to `org.opencontainers.image.revision` when
  outdated, or a pull+`--recreate` hint when newer. **Refuse:** a
  `--self-update` flag (the launcher runs unsandboxed on the host —
  replacing it must stay a deliberate, reviewable act), and hard-failing
  the build on an empty `LAUNCHER_VERSION` ARG (the label is advisory;
  pre-label images exist and must degrade to silence — CodeRabbit asked,
  declined on PR #78). The label key was renamed from
  `io.gilesknap.…` in the DLS-org rebrand (2026-07-24); images built
  before then carry only the old key, so a new launcher reads an empty
  label and degrades to silence — expected, not a bug.
- **PyPI front door (ADR 23, 2026-09-13)**: `uvx claude-sandbox` is the
  launcher and `uvx claude-sandbox install` the guest-devcontainer installer.
  The wheel (`packaging/pypi/`, hatchling, wheel-only) bundles the bash
  VERBATIM via `force-include` and one module execs it; the version is
  the git tag via hatch-vcs (`_dist.yml`/`_pypi.yml`/`_release.yml` copied
  from the DLS python-copier template, wired in `ci.yml`), so wheel == image
  tag (4.0.0 onward; nothing in the tree to bump). The entry point pins `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_IMAGE` to its own version and
  sets `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_LAUNCHER=uvx`, which flips the outdated hint from
  curl to `uvx claude-sandbox@latest`; a copied script keeps `:latest` +
  the label check. Verbs `claude|codex|pi|shell` replaced `--agent` /
  `--shell` (old spellings exit 2 with the new form — no aliases);
  **host-net is the default**, `--bridge` opts out (create-time). The
  launcher refuses inside a container (`/run/.containerenv` or
  `/.dockerenv`; `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_NESTED=1` overrides — also the test seam,
  `tests/launcher.sh` runs against a fake engine); the entry point refuses
  `install` OUTSIDE one (`CLAUDE_SANDBOX_HOST_INSTALL=1` overrides).
  `install.sh` stamps `/usr/libexec/claude-sandbox/installer` = `uvx` so
  `claude-sandbox update` points back at uvx instead of cloning past the
  pin. **Refuse:** logic in the Python module beyond locate + env + exec;
  a second console script or package (reopens `--from` for `@latest`);
  an sdist (a second copy of the tree); a devcontainer *feature* as the
  guest path (considered, slow to start, and useless for the host
  launcher). PyPI trusted publishing needs the `pypi` GitHub environment
  and the project's publisher configured once, by hand.
- **Distribution/conf decisions parked as issues** (re-read before
  re-designing any of these): **#79** ship `/verify-sandbox` as a plugin
  via managed settings — docs-verified that `extraKnownMarketplaces`
  (local path) + `enabledPlugins` is Claude Code's ONLY machine-wide
  command/skill channel (no system commands dir exists; command becomes
  namespaced `/claude-sandbox:verify-sandbox`). **#80** Renovate-pinned
  Claude version (official installer takes `[stable|latest|X.Y.Z]` as
  `$1`; `downloads.claude.ai/claude-code-releases/{latest,stable}`
  return bare version strings). **#81** per-project
  `.claude-sandbox.conf` — see the Invariant 4 carve-out in the
  `claude-sandbox` skill.
- **Image-only Python (2026-09-11)**: the `claude-sandbox` stage bakes a
  uv-managed interpreter at `/opt/uv/python` and an active venv at
  `/cache/venv` (`UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`,
  `UV_TOOL_DIR` all under `/cache`, which the shipped conf already
  `allow-write`s). Why `/cache` and not the workspace: the mounted dir has
  the same path on the host, so a workspace `.venv` ping-pongs between the
  host's interpreter and the container's, and its `bin/python` symlink
  dangles on whichever side didn't build it last. Why not `install.sh`:
  dogfood ≈ guest would then push a venv into every clone+install
  devcontainer, against the bash-only rule. **Refuse:** moving these
  steps into `install.sh` or the `developer` stage; pointing
  `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` back into the workspace; binding `~/.cache`
  back "so Playwright persists" (home is ephemeral on purpose — the fix
  is `pass-env`/`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` under `/cache`). The
  pass-through of `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`/`UV_TOOL_DIR` in the shadow is
  what stops uv re-downloading the baked interpreter each session;
  `tests/bwrap_argv.sh` scenario 8c guards it.
- **Image-only Node (2026-09-11)**: node/npm/npx copied from
  `node:22-slim` into `/usr/local` in the `claude-sandbox` stage — NOT
  apt `npm` (npm 9 on EOL Node 18 + ~360 packages, and Playwright's npm
  package refuses < 20). Enables `pi install npm:...` (persists on the
  shared `~/.pi`). The apt `nodejs` 18 in `apt_install` stays: guests may
  rely on it, and it is merely shadowed by PATH order in the image.
  Refuse: swapping `nodejs`→`npm` in `apt_install`; moving the COPY into
  the `developer` stage.
  `/usr/local/etc/npmrc` sets `ignore-scripts=true` (image-only, ro
  in-session; overridable by ~/.npmrc so a default not a gate) — pi's own
  npm call passes no `--ignore-scripts`. Don't drop it "because package X
  needs postinstall": that is the case for asking the user.
- **Launcher verbs are forwarded (PR #40, 2026-09-14)**: `claude-sandbox`
  names two commands — the host launcher (first word = agent) and the
  in-container helper CLI (first word = verb). The launcher now execs
  `gh-auth|glab-auth|verify|pi-local|version|update` inside the project
  container, so the same spelling works on either side. Refuse: renaming
  the inner CLI (docs, wheel console script and muscle memory all carry
  the name; a rename would not stop the host launcher swallowing the
  verb as an agent arg anyway). Everything else after the options is
  still agent argv (`uvx claude-sandbox --resume` must keep working).
- **Testing a branch end to end (2026-09-15, PR #49)** — the two-command
  naming is a recurring foot-gun: on the HOST, `claude-sandbox verify`
  forwards into the *published image*, so it never tests a branch. Always
  say which terminal. The branch path is: devcontainer terminal →
  `./install --here` → start a FRESH agent session from a scratch dir
  (binds are fixed at launch; an existing session never sees new ones) →
  check inside it → `claude-sandbox verify` from the same devcontainer
  terminal (`which claude-sandbox` = `/usr/local/bin/...`, `version`
  shows `-dirty`). To exercise the WHEEL path from a branch without a
  release, in another devcontainer:
  `uvx --from "git+https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/claude-sandbox@<branch>#subdirectory=packaging/pypi" claude-sandbox install`
  (the `#subdirectory=` is mandatory — pyproject is not at the repo root).
- **`clean [--force] [--images]` (PR #42)**: removes the launcher's
  project containers — stopped only by default, running too with
  `--force`, unused `*/diamondlightsource/claude-sandbox` image tags with
  `--images`. Match is name prefix `claude-sandbox-` AND the keeper
  command, never the name alone. Why it exists: reconnecting keeps the
  image a container was created from, so after a pull it is unclear
  which image a session runs; `--recreate` is one project at a time.
- **Devcontainer-like filesystem view (2026-09-14; parent rw 2026-09-15)**:
  `--no-peers` skips the automatic parent mount at container creation;
  explicit `--mount` and `--mount-rw` still apply. Existing containers need
  `--recreate`; the flag does not alter mounts in independent devcontainers.
  Without the flag, sibling projects remain readable by sandboxed agents.
  the launcher binds the project's PARENT read-write at its host path, as
  the devcontainer's `/workspaces` mount does, and the project rw nested
  over it. First cut made the parent ro; user reversed that 2026-09-15 so
  a shell can start a new sandboxed session in any sibling — not a hazard
  because the shadow binds only `$PWD` rw per session, and the parent is
  NOT added to allow-write. `--mount` is READ-ONLY and `--mount-rw` is
  the old rw + allow-write behaviour. The parent bind is skipped when the parent is
  `/` or contains `$HOME` (a project directly under `~` would hand
  `~/.ssh` and every host token to the container, ro or not — the
  launcher says so). `shell` execs the shell the launcher was run FROM
  (`detect_shell` walks the ancestors; `$SHELL` is only the login shell —
  bash at DLS while terminals run zsh), or `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_SHELL` (per
  run, not create-time; bash fallback inside):
  the DLS base image already installs zsh + oh-my-zsh and writes
  `/root/.zshrc` to source `/user-terminal-config/zshrc`, so the
  terminal-config richness was inherited all along — only the verb
  hard-coded bash. Refuse: hard-coding zsh instead (user declined to force
  it on people). `LANG` is always
  set; `DISPLAY` + `/tmp/.X11-unix` + `~/.Xauthority` (ro) are passed
  only when the host has a DISPLAY, and only the unsandboxed shell sees
  them (the shadow masks `~/.Xauthority`; nothing in the agent path
  changed). Parent and `--mount`/`--mount-rw` binds use `bind-propagation=slave`
  (as builder2ibek's devcontainer does for `/dls_sw`): a rootless
  container may not TRIGGER an autofs mount (`ls /dls_sw/work` → EPERM)
  but host-made mounts propagate in. Refuse: plain `-v` for these
  (loses propagation); mounting the parent when it holds `$HOME`; making
  `--mount` rw again "for convenience"; forwarding DISPLAY into the
  shadow's pass-through list.
- **/cache volume + per-project venv (PR #43, 2026-09-14)**: the launcher
  mounts ONE named volume `claude-sandbox-cache` at `/cache` and sets
  `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`/`VIRTUAL_ENV=/cache/venv-for<project path>`,
  `PRE_COMMIT_HOME`, `UV_PYTHON_CACHE_DIR` at create — the DLS
  python-copier devcontainer layout (`/workspaces/podbench/.devcontainer`).
  THE LESSON (user, after my first cut put only `/cache/uv` on a volume):
  venv and uv cache on the SAME filesystem is the point — uv hardlinks
  wheels into the venv, so installs cost no disk and little time; split
  them and you need `UV_LINK_MODE=copy` and pay a copy per install. And
  persistence of packages was never the goal: that template runs
  `uv venv --clear && uv sync` on every create, the cache makes it fast.
  Image side: PATH carries `/opt/venv/bin`, a CONTAINER-LOCAL symlink the
  entrypoint points at `$VIRTUAL_ENV` (a symlink on the shared volume
  would be shared by every project), created fresh once per container
  (`/var/lib/claude-sandbox/venv-created` marker; restarts keep it).
  `clean` ALWAYS prunes `venv-for<path>` dirs whose container name
  (recomputed from the path) no longer exists, via throwaway `run`s on
  the volume with `--entrypoint find|rm` — the image entrypoint would
  run the userns probe + venv setup first and a refusal there read as
  "0 venvs" (seen on the DLS host). `--venvs` existed for one release
  (4.1.0) and was folded in: a removed container gets a fresh venv on
  create anyway, so the flag only saved disk-cleanup you always want. Refuse: a volume on `/cache/uv` alone; `UV_LINK_MODE=copy`;
  a shared symlink inside the volume; `uv sync` in the entrypoint (runs
  before the session with no feedback — the agent or user syncs).
- **Walked back — EPICS client tools in the image (PR #43, 2026-09-14)**:
  built and green (caget & co. + pvxs `pvx*` copied from
  `ghcr.io/epics-containers/epics-base-runtime:7.0.10ec5`, ld.so.conf,
  libevent, amd64-only per-arch stage), then removed the same day: the
  user judged CA too DLS-specific for a generic tool and not that useful
  (agents are behind the egress jail anyway); a user who wants the
  binaries can copy them in. Don't propose it again; the branch history
  has the working recipe if ever needed.
- **Testing a shadow branch in the launcher container**: `uvx
  claude-sandbox shell`, clone the branch, `./install --here`; verify
  with `cat /usr/libexec/claude-sandbox/version` (branch hash, not a
  tag) and a grep for the new code in `/usr/local/bin/claude`. It lives
  only in that named container: `--recreate` or `clean` reverts it. The
  checks must run INSIDE — on the host `uvx claude-sandbox version`
  launched claude with `version` as its prompt until PR #40.
- **Walked back — filtering terminal escape sequences in the pty relay
  (PR #39, closed 2026-09-14)**: RHEL 8/9 desktop terminals DRAW
  unsupported sequences (`␛[>4;2m`, the modifyOtherKeys enable every
  agent emits) instead of dropping them; it reproduces with a native
  host `claude`, so the sandbox is not the cause. A chunk-safe node
  filter on `script`'s output (`pty_launch`) was built, tested, and
  installed on a DLS box — the junk stayed, and mouse-selection drew
  more of the same, so the user abandoned it as a losing game against
  that terminal. Don't propose stripping sequences again; the real
  answers are a capable terminal or tmux ≥ 3.2 in front of the old one.
  Branch `fix/xtmodkeys-filter` kept. One finding from it is STILL
  UNFIXED on main: the shadow runs `script -q -E never` without `-e`, so
  script always exits 0 and the agent's exit status never reaches the
  caller — `claude-sandbox verify`'s "non-zero on failure" promise is
  broken. Fix is one flag (`script -q -e -E never`) plus a test.
