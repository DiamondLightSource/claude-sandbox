# install_codex_binary: same relocate-after-install dance as Claude, for
# OpenAI's Codex CLI (the client for GPT-6 Astra). Its installer also drops
# the binary into ~/.local/bin and prepends that dir to the user's shell rc,
# so leaving it there would let plain `codex` resolve past our shadow —
# Invariant 1, identically.
#
# BEST-EFFORT, unlike Claude's: a host that cannot reach chatgpt.com, or a
# vendor change to the install script, must not brick a claude-sandbox
# install. We warn and carry on; the codex shadow is still placed, and it
# loud-fails with a re-run-install message if someone types `codex`.
#
# What the vendor installer actually does (verified against
# chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh): it unpacks a versioned release under
# $CODEX_HOME/packages/standalone/releases/<version>/ and puts a SYMLINK to it
# at ~/.local/bin/codex. Two consequences we have to handle:
#
#   1. Relocating the symlink would relocate nothing. We resolve it first and
#      relocate the file it points at.
#   2. The real binary therefore lives INSIDE ~/.codex, which the shadow binds
#      READ-WRITE (it is CODEX_HOME — config and auth live there too). A copy
#      of the agent's own binary inside its writable set is a persistence
#      foothold: a compromised session could rewrite it and be re-executed by
#      the next launch. So we take a COPY to the root-owned, off-PATH,
#      ro-in-sandbox /usr/libexec, exec only that, and the shadow tmpfs-masks
#      $HOME/.codex/packages so the writable vendor tree is not visible in the
#      session at all — exactly what is already done for Claude's versioned
#      binary cache at ~/.local/share/claude.
#   3. ~/.codex is by this point usually a SYMLINK into the shared
#      cross-container store (link_terminal_config runs first), so letting the
#      vendor unpack there would push a versioned release tree — tens of MB,
#      one per release, pruned by nothing — onto the host share, where every
#      container that mounts it inherits the growth. We only ever want the
#      /usr/libexec copy, so the vendor unpacks into a TEMP CODEX_HOME that is
#      deleted once the copy is taken.

# codex_purge_vendor_tree [STAGE]: remove every writable copy of the codex
# package the vendor installer leaves behind, plus the unwrapped `codex` on the
# user's PATH (Invariant 1). Called on every exit path — including the
# idempotent one, so a tree left by an older claude-sandbox is cleaned up too.
